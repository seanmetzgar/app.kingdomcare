### Addressing an Open Issue / Feature Requests

If you're ready to take a crack at one of the open issues, follow these steps:

- Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account.
- Create a branch off of the relevant branch (most likely master). Make sure to name the branch using the Gitflow naming convention. No need to use the git-flow CLI, as it doesn't work well with Fork/PR workflow.
- Keep your changes to a minimum, we may not accept larger commits in to the main repository.
- When you're all done, create a Pull Request (see below for more info).

### Creating Pull Requests

When creating a new Pull Request, be sure to follow the template and guidelines provided. Below is some details about each section outlined in the template. Remember, when adding code, less is more. We may be hesitant to merge large PRs.

- **Title**
    - Lead off with the appropriate [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/).
    - Please also try to use Active-Present voice (Add vs Adds or Added, Fix vs Fixes or Fixed, etc)
    - Example ( :bug: Fix issue with header not displaying correctly in Firefox & Chrome. )
- **Description**
    - Summary of what was added or addressed.
    - Don't included reference links to Issues/Feature Requests here.
- **Addresses Issues**
    - This is where you list any Issue(s)/Feature Request(s) that have been addressed by the commit.
    - Add a bullet for each issue/feature #.
- **Proposed Documentation Changes**
    - If you feel your code warrants a documentation change, and you are unable/uncomfortable to make it yourself... let us know here.

    - Give us 1-2 bullet points we can add to the official release notes.
